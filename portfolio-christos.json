Most recently, I built my own compound interest calculator from first principles. I noticed that a lot of the calculator online lack tranparency in their calculations and can be perceived as fairly limited to a financially educated person. This custom-built calculator is meant to be used by such person. Since this project's completion, I have been exploring the impact of home-building on the broader housing market using a Bayesian Statistics approach. Stay tuned for more updates on that!",
