With the rise of machine learning tools and applications, understanding the mathematical formalism behind these tools is crucial for any data-driven field, especially when selecting the right tool to solve a specific problem.</p>

                  <p>Outside of my research in Physics, I am passionate about understanding and modeling financial markets. Most recently, I built my own compound interest calculator from first principles. I noticed that many calculators online lack transparency in their calculations and can be limited for users who aren&#39;t financially trained. This custom-built calculator is intended for users with a financial background. Since this project&#39;s completion, I have been exploring the impact of home-building on the broader housing market using a Bayesian statistics approach. Stay tuned for more updates!</p>

                  <p>One of the biggest challenges in an analytical field is converting a real-world problem into a mathematical one. This can be achieved with a mathematical parametric model. To extract information about the model one can use the process of linear regression. It is especially relevant in the field of statistics, machine learning, etc. The aim of this project is to illustrate the power of linear regression.</p>
